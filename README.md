# ClipURL
Saving important URLs through chrome folders or the browser is tedious. For this reason, I have created ClipURL. ClipURL is an easy to use chrome extension that let's users save important links from the click of a button. There is no need to organize as it leverages ML to take care of that.

#### To Do (Bugs to fix)
<ul>
  <li>Improve the UI of the extension</li>
  <li>Allow users to detele specific URLs</li>
  <li>Fetch website favicons to display alongside URL</li>
  <li>Allow users to change the URL to a name of their choosing</li>
  <li>Allow for the creation of folders</li>
  <li>Allow for the exportation of URLs into a CSV file</li>
  <li>Leverage GPT and webscrapping to automate the grouping of URLs</li>
  
</ul>
